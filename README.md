# A/B-Testing
# 📰 Which Headline Works Better?  
## A/B Testing with Real API Data

### 📌 Project Brief
This project simulates an A/B test using real-world news data from public APIs to analyze which article headlines or post timings yield better engagement. As a data analyst for a media platform, your goal is to experiment with publishing strategies and recommend the most effective headline features or timing strategies.

### 🎯 Objectives

- **📥 Data Acquisition**
  - Pull real-time and historical news article data (e.g., headlines, timestamps, source) using a public API.
  - APIs considered include:
    - [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)
    - [The Guardian API](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)
    - [Mediastack](https://mediastack.com/)
    - [GNews](https://gnews.io/)

- **🧪 A/B Test Simulation**
  - Articles are randomly assigned into two test groups:
    - **Group A**: Articles published in the **morning** (6 AM–12 PM)
    - **Group B**: Articles published in the **evening** (6 PM–12 AM)
  - Optional variation: Group by **headline length** or **sentiment**.

- **🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploration**
  - Explore structure, data types, and handle missing data via:
    - `fillna()` with median/mode
    - Interpolation (if applicable)
  - Subset data using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`.

- **📊 Analysis & Visualization**
  - Group and analyze metadata (e.g., length, source frequency).
  - Use aggregation and visual tools to uncover trends.
  - Remove outliers based on word count or share metrics.

- **📈 A/B Testing & Interpretation**
  - Perform hypothesis testing with `scipy.stats.ttest_ind`.
  - Visualize results using bar and box plots.
  - Interpret **p-values** and determine statistical significance.

- **🧠 Deliver Insights**
  - Recommend which group performs better.
  - Discuss how missing data or outliers may have influenced the results.
